## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

```
✓ 7 Days Free Trial
```

**For other trial periods**:
```
X Days Free Trial
```

### **Feature Count Badge**

When a plan has `enabledFeatureKeys`:
```
[12 Features Included]  // Badge showing feature count
```

### **Free Plan Display**

For plans with price = 0:
```
Free  // Instead of "BDT 0/month"
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

### **Plan Data Structure**

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  price: number;  // 0 for free
  trialPeriod: number;  // 168 = 7 days
  enabledFeatureKeys?: string[];  // New flexible features
  featureList?: string[];  // Admin-managed descriptions
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **Display Logic**

1. **Feature Count**: Uses `enabledFeatureKeys.length` if available
2. **Feature List**: Uses `featureList` if available, otherwise generates from legacy `features`
3. **Trial Period**: Converts hours to days (168 = 7 days)
4. **Price**: Shows "Free" if price = 0

---
