## Important Notes

⚠️ **Warning**: This will add data to your database. If you want to start fresh:

1. Clear your database first:
   ```bash
   # In MongoDB shell or Compass
   use restaurant_pos
   db.dropDatabase()
   ```

2. Then run the seed script

🔄 **Re-seeding**: You can run the seed script multiple times, but it will create duplicate data. It's recommended to clear the database first.

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection failed"
- Make sure MongoDB is running
- Check your `.env` file has correct `MONGODB_URI`

### "Module not found"
- Run `npm install` in the backend directory

### "Validation error"
- Your database might already have conflicting data
- Try clearing the database first
